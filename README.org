* emacs-modbus

  Modbus support for Emacs

** Goal

   This software is intended to allow Emacs to communicate with Modbus slave
   devices.
   
   There will be two layers; an API layer and a sample application that allows
   Emacs to interact with Modbus devices.  The application will allow simple
   setting and retrieving of values as well as sending arbitrary function
   requests.
   
** Mod/what/?
   
   Modbus is a protocol created by Modicon to enable communication between
   field devices and control devices in industrial applications.  The protocol
   was opened and can be implemented license-free.  It is currently overseen
   by the [[http://modbus.org][Modbus Organization]].
   
** Why?

   I love Emacs and work with SCADA for a living.  That means I do weird
   things, like write tank strapping generators in Common Lisp and fill my
   Emacs lisp directory with functions that make working in Wonderware less
   unpleasant.
